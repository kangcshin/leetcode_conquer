# A valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.

# For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.
# A valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into s = A + B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings.

# Given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s = P1 + P2 + ... + Pk, where Pi are primitive valid parentheses strings.

# Return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of s.

 
# Example 1:

# Input: s = "(()())(())"
# Output: "()()()"
# Explanation: 
# The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
# After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "(()())(())(()(()))"
# Output: "()()()()(())"
# Explanation: 
# The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))".
# After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())".
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "()()"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: 
# The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".
# After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "".
